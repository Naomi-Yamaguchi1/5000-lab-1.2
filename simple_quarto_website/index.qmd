# About Me
Hello! My name is Naomi Yamaguchi, and I am currently a first-year graduate student in the Data Science and Analytics (DSAN) Master's program at Georgetown University.

I grew up in Maryland and studied undergraduate at Salisbury University where I majored with a B.S in Statistics and minored with Data Science. During my undergraduate, I was selected to be part of research project with computer science department and gained real world skills from several internships. After graduation, I spent my summer as a revenue management analyst intern at Georgetown before returning to school to join the world of data science.

Outside of school and work, my hobbies include adventure, workout, playing with my dogs, window shopping, attending concert/festival, and exploring the DC with my friends. Thanks for checking out my portfolio! Here is little information about my dogs for fun fact.

# Introduction

We are currently testing the website for personal portfolio styles. I will be conditional probability from 5100 information for now as a reference [^1].

Bayes Theorem formula:

$$
P(A|B)=\frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
$$ 

is probability of event $A$ given the event $B$ for condition.

# Topic 1
- point 1
- point 2
- point 3

# Topic 3
Example of flowchart and graph using mermaid.

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A[Hard edge] --> B(Round edge)
  B --> C{Decision}
  C --> D[Result 1]
  C --> E[Result 2]
```

```{mermaid}
graph TD;
    A[Square Rect] --> B((Circle));
    B --> C[Round Rect];
    C --> A;
```
